# Jaw tension

Jaw tension, often manifesting as discomfort or tightness in the jaw area, is a common issue that can arise from various causes, including stress, teeth grinding, or TMJ disorders. This tension not only affects the jaw but can also impact the overall facial appearance and well-being.

During your consultation, we will evaluate your jaw tension and explore all suitable treatment options. Frequently, small, precisely targeted injections of botulinum toxin into the masseter muscle (the muscle responsible for chewing, which can contribute to jaw tension) are effective in addressing these issues. These injections work by reducing the activity of the muscle, easing tension and often resulting in a more relaxed jawline and facial appearance.

Your appointment will take approximately 30 minutes and includes a detailed assessment of your facial structure and a discussion to understand your aesthetic and therapeutic goals. If deemed appropriate, we will proceed with administering multiple tiny injections using the smallest needles available for a comfortable experience.

We are committed to providing comprehensive information about various treatments, particularly botulinum toxin injections, to effectively address your specific concerns. Emphasizing informed decision-making, we will discuss the potential risks and benefits associated with each treatment option, ensuring you have all the essential information to make a confident and informed choice regarding your care.
