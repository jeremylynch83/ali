# Axillary hyperhydrosis

Axillary hyperhidrosis, or excessive underarm sweating, is a condition that goes beyond normal perspiration levels and can significantly affect both comfort and confidence. This condition, often embarrassing and inconvenient, can impact daily life and wardrobe choices.

In your consultation, we will assess your specific situation and discuss all available treatment options. A highly effective method for managing axillary hyperhidrosis involves the use of small, precisely targeted injections of botulinum toxin into the underarm area. These injections work by temporarily blocking the signals that stimulate excessive sweat production, providing relief from excessive sweating.

The appointment will take approximately 30 minutes and includes a thorough assessment of your condition and a discussion to understand your goals and concerns. If suitable, we will proceed with administering multiple tiny injections using the finest needles for your comfort.

We are dedicated to providing comprehensive information about the various treatments available, especially botulinum toxin injections, to effectively address your specific needs. Our approach is centered on informed decision-making. We will discuss the potential risks and benefits associated with each treatment option, ensuring that you have all the necessary information to make a confident and informed choice about your treatment.
