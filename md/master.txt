# What are anti-wrinkle injections
Botulinum toxin injections are at the forefront of our treatment options for forehead lines:


- How It Works: This treatment involves the use of botulinum toxin to temporarily paralyze the muscles responsible for wrinkle formation. This relaxation of muscles leads to a significant reduction in the appearance of forehead lines.
- Procedure Details: The procedure is quick, minimally invasive, and requires no downtime. Most clients observe noticeable improvements within a few days, with the results typically lasting several months.
- Safety Profile: We ensure the highest safety standards. We discuss potential side effects and provide detailed post-treatment care instructions to ensure optimal outcomes.


#  Forehead lines


Forehead lines are the horizontal lines that develop over time as we age and are a common aesthetic concern. When we are younger they appear when we raise our eyebrows (dynamic lines) but can deepen over time and become more permanent (static lines) affecting our appearance but more importantly how we feel about ourselves. 


We will assess these lines and cover all treatment options during your consultation. Often, small and precisely targetted injections of botulinum toxin into the frontalis muscle (the muscle of the forehead which is responsible for raising the eyebrows, contributing to these lines) will address these concerns. The injections reduce the activity of this muscle, softening static lines and helping to prevent dynamic lines. 


This appointment will take approximately 30 minutes and involves facial assessment and discussion with you to understand your aesthetic goals and if appropriate, injection of multiple tiny injections using the smallest needles available. 


We provide comprehensive information on how various treatments, especially botulinum toxin injections, can effectively address your specific concerns. We believe in informed decision-making. We will discuss the potential risks and benefits associated with each treatment option, ensuring you have all the necessary information to make a confident choice.

# Frown lines
Frown lines, also known as glabellar lines, are the vertical lines that develop between the eyebrows as we age, becoming a key aesthetic concern for many. In our youth, these lines are dynamic, appearing primarily when we frown or concentrate. Over time, however, they can deepen into static lines, impacting not only our appearance but also how we perceive ourselves.
During your consultation, we will thoroughly assess these lines and explore all available treatment options. Often, carefully targeted injections of botulinum toxin into the muscles responsible for frowning can significantly alleviate these concerns. These injections reduce muscle activity, softening existing static lines and aiding in the prevention of further dynamic lines.
Your appointment will last approximately 30 minutes and will include a detailed facial assessment. We will discuss your aesthetic aspirations and, if suitable, proceed with the application of multiple small injections using ultra-fine needles for minimal discomfort.
We are committed to providing detailed information about how various treatments, particularly botulinum toxin injections, can specifically target your concerns.

# Eye corner wrinkles
Eye corner wrinkles, commonly referred to as crow's feet, are the fine lines that radiate from the corners of the eyes. These wrinkles typically emerge as we age, forming a significant aesthetic concern for many. Initially, they may appear as dynamic lines when we smile or squint, but over time, they can evolve into deeper, static lines, affecting both our looks and our self-esteem.
During your consultation, we will assess these wrinkles and discuss all viable treatment options. A frequent and effective approach involves precise injections of botulinum toxin into the muscles around the eyes. These injections aim to lessen muscle movement, thereby softening existing static lines and helping to prevent the formation of new dynamic lines.
The appointment, lasting around 30 minutes, includes a comprehensive facial evaluation and a conversation with you to understand your aesthetic objectives. If appropriate, we will proceed with administering several small injections using the finest needles for maximum comfort and minimal invasiveness.

# Jaw tension
Jaw tension, often manifesting as discomfort or tightness in the jaw area, is a common issue that can arise from various causes, including stress, teeth grinding, or TMJ disorders. This tension not only affects the jaw but can also impact the overall facial appearance and well-being.
During your consultation, we will evaluate your jaw tension and explore all suitable treatment options. Frequently, small, precisely targeted injections of botulinum toxin into the masseter muscle (the muscle responsible for chewing, which can contribute to jaw tension) are effective in addressing these issues. These injections work by reducing the activity of the muscle, easing tension and often resulting in a more relaxed jawline and facial appearance.
Your appointment will take approximately 30 minutes and includes a detailed assessment of your facial structure and a discussion to understand your aesthetic and therapeutic goals. If deemed appropriate, we will proceed with administering multiple tiny injections using the smallest needles available for a comfortable experience.

# Gummy smile
A gummy smile, characterized by excessive visibility of the gums when smiling, is an aesthetic concern for many individuals. This condition, often a result of the way muscles in the upper lip and face interact, can impact self-confidence and the way one feels about their smile.
In your consultation, we will carefully assess your smile and discuss all treatment options. A common and effective approach to addressing a gummy smile involves small, precisely targeted injections of botulinum toxin into the muscles that control the upper lip. These injections help to relax the muscle, reducing the elevation of the lip when smiling and thereby minimizing the exposure of the gums.
The appointment will last about 30 minutes, including a thorough facial assessment and a discussion with you to understand your aesthetic goals. If appropriate, we will proceed with administering several tiny injections using the finest available needles to ensure comfort and precision.

In your consultation, we will assess your specific situation and discuss all available treatment options.

# Crowns
Dental crowns are a key treatment in restorative dentistry, designed to protect, cover, and restore the shape of your teeth when fillings don't solve the problem. Crowns can be used for a variety of purposes: from repairing a damaged tooth to improving the overall appearance of your smile. They are custom-made to fit over the entire tooth, starting at the gum line, and are typically made of durable materials like porcelain, ceramic, or metal alloys.
During your consultation, we will assess the condition of your teeth to determine if a crown is the right option for you. This could be the case for a tooth that is fractured, severely decayed, or has a large filling. We will also consider crowns for cosmetic enhancement, to cover discolored or poorly shaped teeth.
The process of getting a crown usually requires two appointments. The first appointment involves preparing the tooth, taking impressions for the custom crown, and placing a temporary crown. In the second visit, the permanent crown is fitted and adjusted for comfort and function.
We provide detailed information about the procedure, materials used, and care for your dental crowns. Our approach is to ensure that you are fully informed and comfortable with the treatment plan. We discuss all aspects of the procedure, including potential risks and benefits, so you can make a confident and informed decision about your dental care.
