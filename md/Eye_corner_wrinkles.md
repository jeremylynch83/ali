# Eye corner wrinkles

Eye corner wrinkles, commonly referred to as crow's feet, are the fine lines that radiate from the corners of the eyes. These wrinkles typically emerge as we age, forming a significant aesthetic concern for many. Initially, they may appear as dynamic lines when we smile or squint, but over time, they can evolve into deeper, static lines, affecting both our looks and our self-esteem.

During your consultation, we will assess these wrinkles and discuss all viable treatment options. A frequent and effective approach involves precise injections of botulinum toxin into the muscles around the eyes. These injections aim to lessen muscle movement, thereby softening existing static lines and helping to prevent the formation of new dynamic lines.

The appointment, lasting around 30 minutes, includes a comprehensive facial evaluation and a conversation with you to understand your aesthetic objectives. If appropriate, we will proceed with administering several small injections using the finest needles for maximum comfort and minimal invasiveness.

We are dedicated to providing extensive information about the range of treatments available, particularly the use of botulinum toxin injections, to specifically target your concerns. Our focus is on informed decision-making. We will discuss the potential risks and benefits of each treatment option to ensure that you are fully informed and can make a confident decision about your treatment.
