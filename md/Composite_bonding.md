# Composite bonding

Composite bonding is a versatile dental treatment that enhances the appearance of your teeth, addressing issues such as chipping, discoloration, gaps, and minor misalignments. This technique involves the application of a tooth-colored composite resin to the teeth, which is then shaped and polished to improve overall aesthetics. It's a popular choice for those looking to make subtle but impactful changes to their smile without the need for more invasive procedures.
